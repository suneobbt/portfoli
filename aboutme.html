					<h3>Web aplications developer student</h3>
					<p>Hello! My name is Adrià Babot, currently a web application development student at the IES Joan Ramis i Ramis de Maó institute. Born in Barcelona, ​​where I have lived almost half of my life. I have also lived in Menorca (where I live), in Norway and in Canada.</br>I love traveling, music and nature. I am passionate about the mountain, hiking, mountaineering, skiing, snowboarding, cross-country skiing... While I have cold weather everything is fine!</br></br>I am very organized, curious and observer. I like to discover and do new things constantly, and from here I am studying again. Just over a year later, I decided to "radically" change my profession. My business, to date, is the world of electricity; In particular, elevators and escalators. Since very little, I have fascinated any type of machinery. The machines are easier to understand than people.</br></br>Even so it seems that the world of web programming is doing quite well. With a school year, I'll master the basics of programming, in the hands of Java; Databases, MySql and SqlServer, and Markup Languages. In the world of IDE, I am an apprentice of the simple, Geany or Notepad +. But I also have control over IntellyJ, Netbeans and Eclipse.</br>Apart from programming, I also have the administration of computer systems, both software and hardware. And it does not end here, I am currently struggling to learn JavaScript, PHP, Android and from now on it will also be added Spring and JEE. And finally, as a personal project I have Ruby, C and C ++.<br/><br/>If you want more about me, get in touch! I can answer you in Catalan, Spanish, English or even (with some problems) in Norwegian!</p>
